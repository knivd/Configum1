# Configum1
Embedded FPGA module in PLCC68 format

This tiny module has Spartan-6 FPGA, full power for it (works from any power outside in the range 3.3...20V, and even generates 3.3V for external user circuits), configuration memory, 64Mbytes DDR, microSD holder, 24MHz clock oscillator, JTAG pads, reset button, 8-bit configurable universal ADC/DAC/IO port, and even four on-board user-controllable LEDs.

And this whole this is... only 25x25mm big and fits into a standard PLCC-68 socket.

Applications - everything from industrial control to soft-core modular computers.
